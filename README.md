# Basic TRPC Server

This is a _very_ basic TRPC server and client. I wanted to give TRPC a try, I've heard good things about it for a few years.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run server/index.ts
bun run client/index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.25. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
